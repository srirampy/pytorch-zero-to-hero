## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pytorch-learning-path.git
   cd pytorch-learning-path


2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the notebooks using Jupyter or VSCode.
